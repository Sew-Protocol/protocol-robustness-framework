(ns resolver-sim.protocols.sew.advisory
  "SEW-specific advisory analysis functions.

   These functions read canonical world state and return lightweight analysis
   results (action suggestions, risk signals, payoff projections) without
   executing any state transitions.

   All functions accept a world map and a context map; the session layer is
   responsible for looking up the session and extracting world + context before
   calling these.

   Exposed via DisputeProtocol/advisory in resolver-sim.protocols.sew."
