  "Claimable-classification.v2 taxonomy and terminal-world aggregation.

   Architecture (three layers):

     1. TAXONOMY (lines 15–192)
        Defines the 14 canonical fund classes (v2-classes) and the domain
        vocabulary (canonical-v2-domains).  Each class maps to one or more
        :claimable-v2 domains and carries delivery model, source, risk class,
        category, and boundary invariant references.

     2. AGGREGATION (lines 200–700)
        Pure functions that sum :claimable-v2 balances across terminal worlds,
        grouped by class, by domain, by workflow, and by boundary headroom.
        All operate on immutable world maps — no I/O.

     3. DOCUMENT BUILDING (lines 708–783)
        Assembles the static taxonomy + optional terminal observations into the
        final JSON artifact consumed by notebooks and evidence exporters.

   Flow:
     emit-from-(registry-replay|scenario-file|result-file)!
       → build-document
         → taxonomy-document (static)
         → terminal-observations
           → aggregate-class-observations
           → aggregate-domain-observations
           → boundary-observations
           → scenario-highlights

   Distinct from the legacy invariant `:claimable-classification` (recipient/sender
   split on `:claimable`). This namespace describes :claimable-v2 domains, boundary
   invariants, and optional end-of-run observed balances."
