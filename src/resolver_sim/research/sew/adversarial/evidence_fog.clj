  "Phase Y: Evidence Fog and Attention Budget Constraint.

   Tests whether system correctness holds when:
   - 15% of disputes are hard/ambiguous to verify
   - Resolvers have a fixed attention budget per epoch (20 units)
   - Attackers can pay to inflate evidence complexity
   - Deep verification is 5-10x more costly than shallow

   Hypothesis to falsify:
     'The system maintains >75% correctness even with limited resolver
      budgets and attacker-driven evidence complexity escalation.'

   If correctness drops below 75% under realistic loads, the system
   needs attention-reward design changes before 90% confidence is claimed."
