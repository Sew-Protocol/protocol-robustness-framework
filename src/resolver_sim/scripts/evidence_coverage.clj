(ns resolver-sim.scripts.evidence-coverage
  "Static analysis of evidence capture coverage across protocol namespaces.
   
   Scans defn and defn- forms and checks each for capture-event-evidence! calls.
   Designed for CI integration — exits non-zero on missing critical state-mutating
   transitions.
   
   Usage:
