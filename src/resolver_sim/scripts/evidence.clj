(ns resolver-sim.scripts.evidence
  "CLI wrapper: evidence bundle, signing, and registry helpers.

  Usage:
    clojure -M -m resolver-sim.scripts.evidence bundle <out-dir>
    clojure -M -m resolver-sim.scripts.evidence sign <private-key-path>
    clojure -M -m resolver-sim.scripts.evidence registry [--strict] [run-dir]

  The commands operate on the focused run (results/.notebook-focus) or the
  latest results/test-artifacts directory.

  The registry command does NOT require the focused manifest.

  Options:
    --strict    Enable strict validation mode (promotes warnings to failures)"
