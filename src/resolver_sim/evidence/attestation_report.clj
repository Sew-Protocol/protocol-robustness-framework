(ns resolver-sim.evidence.attestation-report
  "Attestation reporting and aggregation over the attestation registry.

   Builds on the attestation registry's query functions to provide structured
   reports, time-range queries, and grouped aggregations for analysis and audit.

   All functions operate on a sequence of attestation records. Pass the result
   of ar/all-attestations or ar/find-attestations-by-* as the data argument.

   Usage:
     (require '[resolver-sim.evidence.attestation-registry :as ar])
     (require '[resolver-sim.evidence.attestation-report :as arpt])

     ;; Full report over all registered attestations
     (arpt/attestation-report (ar/all-attestations))

     ;; Filtered report for a specific attestor
     (arpt/attestation-report (ar/find-attestations-by-attestor :ci-validation))

     ;; Attestations within a time window
     (arpt/find-attestations-by-time-range (ar/all-attestations)
       \"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \"2025-12-31T23:59:59Z\")"
