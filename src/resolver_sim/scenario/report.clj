(ns resolver-sim.scenario.report
  "Canonical table report for deterministic scenario collection summaries.

   Reporting contract:
   - Pass/fail status comes only from each entry's `:pass?` (set by `scenario.runner`).
   - `:checks` and legacy fields explain failures; this namespace never re-derives pass.
   - For detailed fixture sections (theory/yield columns), use `sim.result-display`.

   Prints only — no replay, no judgement."
