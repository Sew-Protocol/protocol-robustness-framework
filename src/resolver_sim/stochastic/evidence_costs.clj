  "Evidence verification costs and load-dependent strategy selection.
   
   Phase P Lite: Adds attention budget constraint to break infinite-capacity assumption.
   
   Key insight: Under heavy load, honest resolvers can't fully verify everything.
   This makes shortcuts rational → lazy strategy dominates → system breaks.
   
   Also models: evidence forgery cost < verification cost for hard cases.
   This creates an asymmetry where attackers can forge faster than honest can verify."
