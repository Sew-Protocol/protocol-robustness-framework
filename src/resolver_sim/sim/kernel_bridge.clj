(ns resolver-sim.sim.kernel-bridge
  "Kernel validation bridge: validates batch simulation params against the
   Sew protocol replay kernel.

   The stochastic batch runner (sim.batch) models dispute outcomes as probability
   distributions. This namespace validates that the underlying Sew protocol state
   machine is consistent with those parameters by generating minimal dispute
   scenarios and running them through the full replay kernel.

   Usage (optional per-epoch validation in run-single-epoch):
     - Set :kernel-validation-sample-size in params (e.g. 10)
     - run-single-epoch will call run-kernel-validation once per epoch
     - Any kernel invariant violations are reported in the epoch-summary

   Layering: sim/* may import contract_model/* and protocols/* per project rules."
