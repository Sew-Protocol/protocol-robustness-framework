(ns resolver-sim.sim.defection
  "Agent strategy adaptation model.

   Supports multiple strategy selectors:
   - :binary-payoff        (legacy compatibility selector)
   - :load-optimal         (load-aware strategy targeting)
   - :multi-strategy-payoff (reserved for future implementation)
   - :grim-trigger         (defect forever after detecting opponent defection)
   - :tit-for-tat          (mirror opponent's last epoch action)
   - :forgiving            (tit-for-tat with probabilistic forgiveness)

   Preferred config shape:
     :strategy-adaptation
     {:enabled true
      :rate 0.15
      :selector :load-optimal
      :allowed-targets #{:honest :lazy :malicious}}

   Backward compatibility:
   - :defection-rate and :defection-model are still supported.
   - If neither config shape enables adaptation, histories are unchanged.

   Pro-rata resolver threshold:
   When the :load-optimal selector is active, each resolver's strategy payoff is
   evaluated using its *individual* dispute load (not the global epoch total).
   Dispute volume is distributed proportionally by effort-budget capacity via
   `ec/prorata-dispute-load` (Hare-quota method), so a resolver with twice the
   budget correctly sees twice the load in its threshold calculation.

  "Evaluate per-resolver strategy adaptation using load-optimal threshold.

   ## Pro-rata dispute load
   Rather than passing the global `_epoch-trials` to every resolver's payoff
   calculation, we first distribute the total dispute volume proportionally
   by each resolver's effort budget (capacity) using `ec/prorata-dispute-load`
   (Hare-quota / largest-remainder method).

   Rationale: a resolver with effort-budget B_i facing D_i = D × (B_i / ΣB_j)
   disputes experiences effort-per-dispute = B_i / D_i = ΣB_j / D — which is
   the same for all resolvers when budgets are equal (uniform case).  When
   budgets differ, each resolver correctly sees its own load level and therefore
   the correct honest/lazy/malicious payoff crossover (rational threshold).

   Evidence: Hare-quota guarantees (conservation + quota rule) are proved in
   pro_rata_proportional_math_spec.md and enforced by assertions inside
   `largest-remainder-alloc` and `prorata-dispute-load`."
