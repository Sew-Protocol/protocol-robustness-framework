(ns resolver-sim.sim.trial-router
  "TrialRouter — protocol and implementations for assigning batch trials to
   individual resolvers in a multi-epoch simulation.

   The router answers the question: given N trial results and M resolvers,
   which resolver handled which trials?

   ## Conservation guarantee
   Every router implementation must satisfy — for each pool (honest / strategic):
     (sum :profit attributed to all resolvers) == (sum :profit in trial pool)
     (sum :trials attributed) == (count trial pool)
     (sum :slashed attributed) == (count (filter :slashed? trial pool))

   These are verified by `assert-conservation!` below.

   ## Routing modes

   | Mode                 | Purpose                                          |
   |----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | :uniform-random      | baseline — seeded shuffle then round-robin       |
   | :capacity-weighted   | realistic load (future)                          |
   | :reputation-weighted | rich-get-richer dynamics (future)                |
   | :adversarial-routing | targeted slow-drip / ring pressure (future)      |

   Only :uniform-random is implemented in this branch. The interface is defined
   so the others can be added without changing multi_epoch.clj.

   Layering: sim/* only. No db/*, io/* imports."
