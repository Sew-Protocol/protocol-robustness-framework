(ns resolver-sim.protocols.sew.dispute-capacity-test
  "Unit and integration tests for DRM resolver capacity tracking.

   Covers:
     - resolver-capacity world-state accessors
     - raise-dispute blocked when resolver at maxConcurrentDisputes
     - counter increment on dispute open
     - counter decrement on execute-resolution → execute-pending-settlement
     - counter decrement on auto-cancel-disputed-escrow
     - resolver-capacity-invariant? holds throughout all paths
     - capacity freed and reusable after finalization
     - all-resolvers-full system liveness scenario"
